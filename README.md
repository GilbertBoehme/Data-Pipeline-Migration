Understanding the complex dynamics between the natural environment and human migration is crucial in the face of unprecedented global climate change. This thesis delves into the field of quantitative migration research, focusing on the impact of selected short- and long-term climate effects on international migration patterns. The primary objective is to investigate whether and how these effects influence international migration to the 27 member states of the European Union (EU27) by geographic region and income level. Further topics such as agricultural employment and water stress level, various natural disaster types, return migration, zero inflation and the potentially endogenity in migration networks are addressed.

The research findings suggest that decisions to migrate internationally to the EU27 are mainly motivated by socio-economic factors such as armed conflict, social networks, language commonality and higher wages. It challenges the common belief that climate change directly causes international migration by worsening living conditions. Drought disasters appear to hinder global migration to the EU27, while increasing climate anomalies increase migration from the Global North. Especially for poorer countries in the Global South, no significant effects were found for all climate variables.
